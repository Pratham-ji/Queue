# QUEUE

QUEUE is a hospital appointment and queue-token management system built to eliminate physical waiting lines in hospitals.

Patients can book appointments online, receive digital queue tokens, track real-time progress, and get notified when their turn is approaching.

## Problem Statement

Hospitals still rely on physical queues and manual token systems, leading to:
- Long waiting times
- Overcrowding
- Poor patient experience
- Lack of transparency

QUEUE solves this by moving the entire queue system online.
